        <p> Rome is a destination well served by cinema, from its photogenic hilltop 
        towns and alfresco caf√© culture to its cultural and romantic sensibilities. 
        The good news is that there is no shortage of movies set in Rome.</p>

        <p>Not all of these movies are masterpieces (although there are a few that 
        are). However, in some way, each of them effectively showcases the Italian 
        landscape, its culture or society.</p>

        <p>Discover the top movies featuring Rome below...</p>
